Convergence Testing with the Sod Shock
======================================

The scripts in this folder are used to test the SodShock for convergence.  Due
to the requirement of recompiling with different hydrodynamics schemes, the
`./run_convergence.sh` script will actually clone the whole repository from the
GitLab.

These tests may take a couple of hours to run, so be careful! They are not
something that you want to run on your laptop.
